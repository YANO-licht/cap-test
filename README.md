Library Management System API
Overview

The Library Management System API is a Django-based backend application for managing library resources. It allows users to perform CRUD operations on books and library users, as well as checkout and return books. The project uses Django REST Framework (DRF) for API creation, and user authentication is managed with Django's built-in authentication system.
Features

    CRUD Operations: Create, read, update, and delete books and library users.
    User Authentication: Login functionality using Djangoâ€™s authentication system.
    Book Checkout and Return: Allows authenticated users to check out and return books.
    Transaction History: Provides checkout history for users.
    Public Book List: Displays available books to non-authenticated users.

Technologies Used

    Django: Backend framework for building the API.
    Django REST Framework: For creating and managing the API endpoints.
    PythonAnywhere: Hosting for deployment.
